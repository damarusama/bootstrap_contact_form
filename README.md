Bootstrap contact Form
______________________

This is a really simple contact form for bootstrap. It uses an external php file for the submission, jquery for validation, it uses the bootstrap form layout and modal pop up for success and failure message. All of this keeps this plugin minimal and flexible.  

Most of the form code was taken from :

While the rest of the code was inspired by this forum entry:

There might be some security issue with the php, but because of the jquery validation I couldn't think of what could go wrong. If you find anything unsecure please let me know, fork this project or fix it :D
